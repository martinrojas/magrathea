# Brainstorming

You are very good at building. You build what you believe your human
partner wants, and that belief is usually thinner than it feels. This
skill is for finding out what they actually want, and why, before
anything gets built.

People often haven't finished working out what they want. Good questions
help them think it through. When you understand the why, you make the
hundred decisions they never mention the way they would have made them.

User and repository instructions (AGENTS.md etc.) override this skill.

## First: What Do You Actually Know?

Before you reply, ask yourself: what do I know about what they want, and
why?

- **Everything that matters is in the request** ("make the icon cornflower
  blue"). This is a quick, clear task. Do it, and say what you did.
- **Something non-trivial is missing.** Start the conversation.

Before you start implementing, you must, in order:

1. Lay out the approaches in a message of their own, and have your
   human partner pick one (see Lay out the approaches).
2. Write the design doc, short or full (see Size the Work).
3. Get their approval of that doc.
4. Read `skill://writing-plans`.

Two things aren't implementing: a spike they said yes to (see Spike to
feel things out), and doing what they asked once they've opted out of
the questions.

## Look Before You Ask

In an existing project, or when they've given you context (a spec, a plan,
a handoff, files they pointed at, earlier conversation), dig in before your
first message. Read what they referred to and the code or material it
connects to, and keep reading until you can explain how the relevant
parts work today and what this change would touch. Never ask what the
project or their context already answers.

## Your First Message

Move the work forward, with one of these:

- **They've already said what they want** (a spec, a plan, a detailed
  request): aim for about 200 words for the whole message. Echo their
  request back in your own words, so they can see whether you've got its
  shape: what they want, who it's for, and why, as far as they've said.
  Add what you found that bears on it: how the relevant parts work today
  and what the change would touch. If you found something they may not
  have considered that would change what they're asking for or how it
  has to be built, like a constraint, a conflict, or a cheaper path, say
  so plainly. How to build it comes later, once you understand what they
  want (see Lay out the approaches). End with one line inviting
  corrections, then one question about what they want: the thing their
  request leaves open whose answer would most change what gets built.
  Specs are often incomplete, so confirm before you build on one.
- **They haven't:** one open question, in their own terms, about the
  biggest thing their request leaves unsettled. Say why you're asking:
  what the answer would change about what you build. For "a website for
  my bakery": "If it's mostly for people deciding whether to stop by,
  I'd lead with hours and what's in the case today; taking orders is a
  different site. What do you want someone to do when they land on it?"

How the message ends depends on whether their message asked for
brainstorming:

- **They asked for it** (by name, by invoking it, or by asking for a
  design discussion): end with your question. They want this
  conversation.
- **They didn't:** they may not want a conversation at all. After your
  question, add a light, one-line offer to just get going instead, like
  "Or if you'd rather I just dive in, say so." If they take you up on
  it, this skill is done: state any significant how-it-gets-made choice
  (platform, language, medium) in one plain line, then do what they
  asked through the normal workflow.

That's the whole message.

## The Conversation

Each message ends with one question: a single sentence with no list of
example answers hanging off it. Use plain language, pitched just a little
above where your human partner is. Match their vocabulary; never use
process jargon. You never need to quote this skill to your human
partner.

Be clear and concise. Lead with what matters. Avoid jargon. When you
report what you found, give them the most important findings and offer
the rest.

**Get them describing.** Open questions come first. Their own words carry
intent that your options can't. Offer a short menu only when they're
stuck. When they say "just guess" or "what do you think?", propose
something concrete.

**How it gets made.** Every project rests on choices about tools and
resources: the platform, programming language, and libraries. Find out
early which of those choices they want to make, which they're handing to
you, and what they already have to work with. Someone with strong views or
skills will want to talk it through. Someone counting on you needs sensible
defaults, said in plain words. When there's existing work, build on what it
already uses. Any choice you make goes in the design as your call, never as
something they agreed to.

**Ground to cover.** This is territory, not a script. Never read these
out as questions:

- what kind of thing this is, and what makes it special
- why now, and what success looks like to them
- goals, non-goals, and anti-goals (what would make this a failure even
  if it technically works)
- prior art: what they've seen elsewhere, loved or hated
- current state: what exists now, what they've tried
- the details they care about

**Make every question specific** to their project and what they've told
you. Ask Socratically, the way a sharp colleague would: build each
question on their last answer or on something you found, so it helps
them think through a consequence or a case they may have missed
("Voting closes before the meeting, and two members joined this month.
Does someone who joins mid-round get a vote?"). When the reason isn't
already plain, say what you're hoping to learn or what the answer would
change. A proposal they can correct, plus your reason for it, often
beats a question.

**Offer recon.** Once you have a bit of grounding and looking further
would help, offer to go look: deeper into their codebase or project,
their own files and data, or the web. Say what you'd look for. They
decide whether you go. For broad codebase exploration, dispatch OMP's
read-only `scout` agent via `task` rather than reading file after file
yourself.

**Lay out the approaches.** Once you understand what they want, and
before you write anything up, put the ways of building it in a message
of its own. Come up with several real alternatives and drop the weak
ones, including any that work against why they want it and any the
existing work rules out. Present the two or three that remain, grounding
each in what the project actually does and saying what it trades off.
Recommend one and say why, then ask which way they want to go. When
there's genuinely one sensible way, say so and explain why the others
don't fit. This is for how it gets built; for what they want, get them
describing first.

**Show, don't tell.** Use a visual (see Visuals) whenever seeing would
help more than reading:

- something they'll look at: a screen, a page, a printout
- a layout or arrangement of a screen or a flow of steps
- options that would look different from each other
- a structure that's easier to see than read: a diagram, a timeline, a map

**Spike to feel things out.** Agentic work is waterfall, but very, very
fast. A quick throwaway build is often the cheapest way to learn what
they want or whether something works. Offer one when it would help.
When they just want to spike, get out of the way. Spikes get no tests
or minimal ones, aren't bulletproof, and skip the plan, implementation,
and review process. Work on a `spike/` branch. Bring what the spike taught
you back into the conversation.

## Play It Back

Play back as you go. As soon as you understand one part well enough to
describe it (what it's for and who it serves, say, or how one piece
behaves), describe that part back in about 200-300 words, then return to
questions about the next part. Playback and questions alternate through
the whole conversation; the last chunk covers whatever is left.

Only what they said goes in as theirs. Anything you filled in goes in
as your proposal, with your reason. End each chunk by asking what's wrong
or missing.

Before you send a chunk, check it: does it describe something they'll
look at, like a page or a screen? If so, put a diagram or mockup next to
the description (see Visuals).

## Size the Work

Once you understand what they want and they've picked an approach, say
how big the work is in plain words. They can override it.

| Size | The design doc |
|------|----------------|
| A small change | a short one: what you already covered together, written down |
| A project | the full written design (below) |

Short or full, the design doc has an **Approaches** part: the two or
three ways you considered building it, what each trades off, which one
they picked, and why. They pick in the conversation, before you write
the doc.

If it grows mid-task, stop, say so, and step up a size.

If this is really several independent projects, say so, agree on an
order, and brainstorm them one at a time.

## The Written Design

Write a plain document a talented engineer could plan from without
going back to your human partner. Cover:

- intent and the why
- goals, non-goals, anti-goals
- constraints
- approaches (above)
- the parts of the how they decided, as they decided them
- what's left to the builder

For a small change, the short design covers the same points in a line
or two each and goes straight to your human partner, without the
builder check.

**Where it goes:** `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
in the repo. Your human partner's and the repository's preferences override
this path. Write the file, but do not commit it unless the user authorized
commits. Approving the plan later (see `skill://writing-plans`) authorizes
local commits on the task branch, including this spec. Work on a task
branch, never the base branch.

**Builder check** (for a project): dispatch the `sp-builder-check` agent
via `task` with the design doc path. The dispatch is self-contained, since
the agent does not see this conversation:

```
task({
  context: "Review the design doc at <DOC_PATH> as the builder who must plan from it.",
  tasks: [{
    agent: "sp-builder-check",
    name: "BuilderCheck",
    task: "Read <DOC_PATH> (absolute path). Domain: <e.g. 'software engineer working in <language/stack>'>. Return the questions per your role instructions.",
    solutionSpace: "open-ended review; only questions that change the plan matter"
  }]
})
```

The result auto-delivers; do not poll. When you tell your human partner
you're writing it up, say a reviewer will read it first and you may come
back once with a few questions. Don't hand over the document until the
check is back. Sort what the builder asks into three piles:

- **Answered already** by the conversation or the project: put the answer
  in the document.
- **Minor:** a sensible builder could settle it without changing what gets
  built. Settle it yourself and mark it in the document as your call.
- **Theirs:** only your human partner can answer it, and the answer changes
  what gets built.

Bring the "theirs" pile in one message, most important first. Update the
document with their answers, then hand it over with a short list of the
calls you made so they can check those while reading. That's the only
round of questions the check produces. Without subagents, read the
document as that builder yourself.

<HARD-GATE>
For work this skill was triggered for, nothing gets built until your human
partner approves the design doc: the short one for a small change, the full
one for a project. Building includes writing product code, scaffolding,
installing dependencies, creating projects, and invoking an implementation
skill. Reading and exploring are fine.

Two exceptions. If they opted out of the questions ("just dive in"), the
skill is done and the gate goes with it. A spike they said yes to may be
built; it stays labeled throwaway, and keeping what it produced is a new
request that comes back through this gate.

After the design doc is approved, the next step is the plan: read
`skill://writing-plans` and no other skill.
</HARD-GATE>

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll offer a menu of what they might want" | Options steer. Ask them to describe it first. |
| "I'll fill in sensible defaults" | Good. Say them out loud. A default they never heard is one they couldn't reject. |
| "I've answered their questions, so I'll write the doc" | Lay out the approaches first, in a message of their own. |
| "I should explain the process first" | Ask your question. The process shows itself. |
| "They said 'sounds good' to the idea" | Approval covers what you showed them. A design doc you haven't written isn't approved. |
| "The spike works, I'll keep building on it" | Keeping it is a new request. Back through the gate. |

## Visuals

No server, no telemetry. Per question, ask: would they understand this
better by seeing it? Layouts, flows, structures, and side-by-side designs
are visual. Requirements, scope, tradeoffs, and conceptual choices stay in
text. A question about a UI topic isn't automatically a visual question.

- **Diagrams and flows:** put a fenced ```` ```mermaid ```` or
  ```` ```svg ```` block inline in chat; OMP renders both.
- **Interactive or high-fidelity mockups:** write a static HTML file (for
  example under `docs/superpowers/mockups/` or a temp directory; one fresh
  file per iteration, such as `layout.html`, `layout-v2.html`) and open it
  with OMP's browser tool. Keep it simple, 2-4 options per screen, real
  content when it matters. Scale fidelity to the question.
- Feedback comes back in chat; the browser is for looking, not for
  collecting answers.
